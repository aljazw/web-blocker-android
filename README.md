# üîí SiteLock

**SiteLock** is a Android application built with **React Native + TypeScript**, designed to **block unwanted websites** using **Android Accessibility Services**. By detecting and redirecting blocked URLs in real time, SiteLock provides a lightweight, non-root solution for managing digital distractions.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Although SiteLock is built with React Native, it currently supports **Android only** due to its dependence on Android Accessibility Services and native Android modules.



## üöÄ Features

- üîó URL blocking via Accessibility Service
- ‚öôÔ∏è Custom native Kotlin modules for enhanced control
- üì± Easy-to-use interface built with React Native and TypeScript
- ‚è∞ Configurable blocked websites with schedules and time restrictions
- üîí Privacy-First Approach. All blocking logic runs on-device ‚Äî no internet access or external tracking involved.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
> üí° **Before you start:**  
> Ensure your development environment is set up by following the official [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) (choose the **React Native CLI** tab).

### Step 1: Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aljazw/web-blocker-android.git
   cd web-blocker-android
   npm install
   ```
### Step 2: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android app:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio.
